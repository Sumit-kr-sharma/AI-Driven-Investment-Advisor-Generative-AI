# AI-Driven-Investment-Advisor-Generative-AI
The project involved creating an AI-driven assistant designed to provide personalized investment advice to retail investors. This was achieved by developing a system that could analyze market trends, extract relevant text from PDF-based annual reports using OCR tools, and generate financial insights. The project also integrated a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with vector search and chaining techniques to enhance data accuracy. Advanced model optimization techniques were employed to boost the performance of the underlying language model, enabling faster and more accurate financial analysis.
